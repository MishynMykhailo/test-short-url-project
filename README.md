# test-short-url-project
Requirements test-task:
Task: Implement a URL shortener API.
The API should have the following functionality:
<ul>
<li>It should allow users to create a short URL for a given long URL.</li>
  <li>The API should generate a short URL that is unique and easy to
remember.</li>
  <li>The API should redirect to the original long URL when a short
URL is accessed.</li>
  <li>The API should handle errors gracefully and return appropriate
error messages (e.g., if the short URL does not exist).</li>
</ul>
  Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>Use TypeScript and Nest.js.</li>
  <li>You should be able to explain your implementation choices and
justify your design decisions.</li>
  <li>Keep your code clean, reusable, and consistent. Follow best
practices and a good project structure. The main thing is to find
a balance between the speed of work and the quality of the
code.</li>
  <li>The result of the task should be available in GitHub repository.</li>
</ul>
Would be nice:
<ul>
  <li>Add unit tests</li>
  <li>Add simple but good-looking React app</li>
